# StarWars Blog with React and our API

We've build this blog to use a StarWars API we created: https://github.com/andresborn/sw-flask-api-template

This version has been updated to include:
- Authentication using **JWT**
- Fetching protected data using tokens
- **Register** and **Login** pages

This version was built as an upgrade of the original sw-blog: https://github.com/andresborn/sw-blog
