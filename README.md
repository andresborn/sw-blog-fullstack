# StarWars Blog with React and API

We've build this blog to use a **StarWars API** we created: https://github.com/andresborn/sw-flask-api-template

This version has been updated to include:
- Authentication using **JWT**
- Fetching protected data using tokens
- **Register** and **Login** pages

Currently there is no live version as we haven't published our API.

You can clone this repo and our SW API repo and run them simultaneously to see them at work.

For reference, you can find our **original version** that uses the **third-party API** from SWAPI.dev at: https://github.com/andresborn/sw-blog
